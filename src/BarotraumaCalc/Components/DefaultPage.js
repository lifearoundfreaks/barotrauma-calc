        <h4>What I currently plan on adding:</h4>
        <h6>Ability to choose a target destination. Buying prices will be from your starting destination and selling prices will be from the target one.</h6>
        <h6>Main page calculator that will give you a summary of items which are profitable to buy for trade for crafting as well as the summary of most used ingredients in those crafts. All of that considering currently selected route.</h6>
        <h6>Make items in  the "Used in" and "Scrapped from" blocks color coded to indicate which related crafts of the item are profitable.</h6>
        <p>If you have found a bug or have a suggestion for me, you can <a href="https://github.com/lifearoundfreaks/barotrauma-calc/issues/new">start an issue</a>.</p>
